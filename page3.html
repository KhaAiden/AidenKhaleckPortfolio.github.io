	<p>The project, titled "Sneaker," focuses on designing the Nike Jordan 1, a sneaker rich in cultural significance. As a sneakerhead, the process illuminated the extensive culture surrounding these shoes, rooted in Michael Jordan's influence and deeply connected to Black culture.

Created in Minecraft, the sculpture employs the game’s block-based environment to capture the sneaker’s distinctive features and textures, showcasing both creativity and technical skill. Sneakers symbolize excellence in sports and have evolved into iconic streetwear, serving as a vital form of self-expression and fostering community among enthusiasts. Ultimately, this exploration highlights the powerful intersection of culture, identity, and community within sneaker culture.<p>
